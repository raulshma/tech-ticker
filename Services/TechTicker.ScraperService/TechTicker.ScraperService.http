### TechTicker Scraper Service API Testing

# Note: The Scraper Service is a Worker Service that primarily communicates via RabbitMQ messages
# It does not expose HTTP endpoints for direct testing
# This file is included for consistency with other services in the solution

### RabbitMQ Message Testing
# To test the Scraper Service:
# 1. Ensure RabbitMQ is running
# 2. Start the TechTicker solution with Aspire
# 3. Send ScrapeProductPageCommand messages to the scraper queue
# 4. Monitor the output queues for RawPriceDataEvent and ScrapingResultEvent messages

### Example message structure for ScrapeProductPageCommand:
# {
#   "CorrelationId": "12345",
#   "ProductId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
#   "Url": "https://example.com/product",
#   "Priority": 1,
#   "ScrapingSettings": {
#     "ProductNameSelector": ".product-title",
#     "PriceSelector": ".price",
#     "StockStatusSelector": ".stock-status",
#     "RequestDelay": 1000,
#     "UserAgent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36"
#   }
# }

### Monitoring
# Monitor service logs for scraping activity and error handling
# Check Aspire dashboard for service health and message flow
